The wireframe visually consists of four areas: a navigation menu at the top, the page title below that, a gallery containing six items, and a news sidebar on the right. The navigation menu covers the full width of the wireframe and contains four menu entries: "Museum of Odds & Ends", "Visit Us", "Shop", and "Our History". The page title area contains the title of the page, which is "Museum of Odds & Ends", and the location of the museum, which is "Walton Hall, Milton Keynes". Below the page title area are both the gallery and news sidebar. The gallery takes up three-quarters of the page width and the news sidebar one quarter. The gallery contains six items in two rows of three. Each item consists of an image and a title below it. The news sidebar consists of the heading "News" and then two news entries. Each news entry consists of a heading, below that the date for the news entry, and below that the news entry text itself.
